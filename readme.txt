This web application was created for CSE 769 "Applied Distributed Enterprise Computing" at The Ohio State University.

Overview:
This is an event posting board developed in Java (EE) and deployed using the JBOSS application server. Users are able to browse and filter events according to category, login to save/remove events to their personal account as well as post new events. The browsing page features paging in which AJAX calls dynamically load the list of events upon each new page selection. Technologies used included XML, AJAX, JavaServer Pages (JSP), Java Servlets and Enterprise Java Beans.

Usage:
Navigating to the page "inject" will insert dummy data into the database. In particular, a user with credentials "Aaron" and "123" as the username and password, respectively, is created.
